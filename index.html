      <h2>Puerto Plata</h2>

      <p> Puerto Plata is the most beautiful city in the DR. he beaches are fabulous. 
        The chain of the 3 Riu Hotels have excellent food and intertainment. 
        The veiw was breath taking. Went on the cable car trip, rum factory, their fort, lunch and a little shopping. 
        Not an area where I would feel going with out a guide would be a good idea, but everyone there treats you so well. 
        Lots of poverty in this country, yet like our guide said, it has a lot of wealth as far as growing fruit, cattle, sugar cane, vegetables, and tourism. 
        Great vacation.</p>
